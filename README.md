# Motivation

-   Do you want to have a fulfilling career that pays well?

    _Yes! This will allow me to not only fulfill my ambitions in web development but also make it a lucrative career that benefits all areas of my life._

-   Are you excited by the creative outlet programming provides?

    _Yes! Given that I have always been a passionate crative individual this will not only allow me to have a lucrative career but also pitch in with creative ideas that will make a lasting impact on the users._

-   Are you determined to develop the skills and abilities to build any app you can think of?

    _Yes! Starting out by learning web development through a bootcamp gave me the fundamentals of how I might approach something like this but it has only left me with a lot to desire and no depth any particular skill. I now aim to aquire that depth by learning about Full Stack Development and not only that but also take that new aquired knowledge and put into practice with projects that solve real world problems._

# Growth Mindset

-   I can learn new skills and develop new talents with persistence and grit.
-   Always remind yourself that you may not get it _yet_ but that with persistence and grit you will! Struggling with something is growth.
-   Be sure to celebrate your persistence in overcoming those struggles!
-   When you find yourself questioning your abilities, reflect on the successes you have already achieved while learning to program. This is all the proof you need that you can do it.

# The learning process

-   Learning concepts and then practicing them will help you to more fully understand how things work and fit together.

-   Projects are the ultimate method for ensuring that your theoretical understanding aligns with how the programming concepts and techniques actually operate.

-   **Focus mode** occurs when you are consciously focusing on learning, reading, watching videos, or working on a project.

-   **Diffuse mode** occurs subconsciously, at times when you are not actively learning, such as when you’re doing the dishes, exercising, or sleeping. In this state, your mind goes about the business of connecting what you have been learning to the other things you know. This is where breakthroughs happen.

-   The trick is to put effort into solving the problem first and then take a break. In short, understand it, practice it, and finally teach it.

# What to do when you’re stuck

-   You will inevitably get stuck at some point, perhaps due to a concept that you are having difficulty understanding or perhaps due to something not working correctly in a project. Whatever it is, use the following tools to get unstuck:
    -   Google it: You can be certain someone else out there has encountered the same problem as you at some point.
    -   Take a break: Allow your diffuse learning state to work on the problem.
    -   Go to places like forums but remember that fellow developers will be more willing to help you when they can see you have already put effort into trying to figure out the solution on your own.

# Learning framework

-   Do the lesson
-   Practice the concept
-   Are you aware about how problems can be solved with what you learned? If YES, finish exercise, if NO, research and experiment more and ask for guidance.

# The pitfalls of using AI during learning

1. By using a generative AI, learners may miss the opportunity to discover how something works and why things are done that way.

2. Asking good questions is an important skill, and relying on generative AI instead of asking people (like our helpful Discord community) can delay the development of this skill.

3. Learning to talk about the code that one writes is another important skill. In a professional environment, it is highly likely that you will be doing code reviews where you have to explain the how and why behind what you are presenting.

4. As David Humphrey mentions, the output of generative AI must be closely scrutinized, and learners who are new to programming generally don’t have a good overall understanding to be able to determine if the output is good or bad.

5. While learning how to provide good prompts to an AI tool is a skill, it is supplementary to developing foundational programming skills. The Odin curriculum strives to teach that foundational skill.

6. AI tools are designed to answer questions and are not designed to help learners develop research and problem solving skills. If you ask an AI for information, it will provide information to you. If you ask a human, they may invite you to share your understanding of the problem and offer some guidance on how to discover a solution.

7. Without practice in research, problem solving and critical thinking, interviews could be a struggle since it is very likely that applicants would not be allowed to use AI tools.

Therefore in the development of these crucial skills AI tools are not recommended.

# Managing study time

-   Be consistent, a couple hours per day beat a single day of intense learning. Build a daily habit.
-   Avoid comparing yourself with more experienced developers, and learn at your own pace, just because an advanced concept takes longer for you to grasp doesn't make you less of an engineer in the long run.
-   Stress and anxiety absolutely do not help you learn either. Relax and just enjoy the ride.

# Pitfalls to avoid while learning

-   Time a few sessions per day and take breaks between. Use Tomito to your advantage and let it do the work of keeping your sessions on track.
-   Avoid long study sessions, this often leads to **burnout**, which consequently results in lower productivity.
-   It may seem counterintuitive, but you will actually get more done if you regularly step back to recharge your brain and body.

## Break activities suggestions

-   Music
-   Journal
-   Meditate
-   Game
-   Walk

## Digital distractions

Keep these out of your study sessions:

-   Social media
-   Email
-   Time-wasting websites (Youtube included)

## Psysical distractions

Keep your environment comfortable and focused, avoid:

-   TV noise
-   People talking in the background
-   Appliance noises (washing machine, etc...)

## Rabbit Holes

-   Stick to the path laid out as much as possible. Try to limit time spent going down rabbit holes, as these sidetracks can really ruin your momentum.
-   Comparison, this is a recipe for depression and frustration. Only compare yourself to your past self.
-   Instead of taking notes to use as direct references, make notes that can serve as prompts for further research.
