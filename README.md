# Motivation

-   Do you want to have a fulfilling career that pays well?

    _Yes! This will allow me to not only fulfill my ambitions in web development but also make it a lucrative career that benefits all areas of my life._

    _Yes! Given that I have always been a passionate crative individual this will not only allow me to have a lucrative career but also pitch in with creative ideas that will make a lasting impact on the users._

    _Yes! Starting out by learning web development through a bootcamp gave me the fundamentals of how I might approach something like this but it has only left me with a lot to desire and no depth any particular skill. I now aim to aquire that depth by learning about Full Stack Development and not only that but also take that new aquired knowledge and put into practice with projects that solve real world problems._
