    _Yes! Starting out by learning web development through a bootcamp gave me the fundamentals of how I might approach something like this but it has only left me with a lot to desire and no depth any particular skill. I now aim to aquire that depth by learning about Full Stack Development and not only that but also take that new aquired knowledge and put into practice with projects that solve real world problems._
