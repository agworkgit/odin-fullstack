# Web Fundamentals

## What is a web server?

A web server is a computer running web server software (like Apache or Nginx) that stores and delivers web pages, files, and data to clients over the internet using HTTP or HTTPS protocols.

## What is a network?

A network is a collection of interconnected computers and devices that communicate and share resources using transmission media (wired or wireless) and networking protocols like TCP/IP.

## What is the internet?

The internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that communicate using the TCP/IP protocol. It’s made up of routers, switches, servers, ISPs, and physical infrastructure like undersea fiber optic cables and data centers.

## What is an IP address?

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) uniquely identifies a device on a network. It’s like a virtual street address, used to send and receive data between devices. Most home devices get their IP addresses automatically from the ISP via DHCP. (e.g., IPv4: 192.168.1.1 or IPv6: fe80::1).

## What is a router?

A router is a network device that directs data packets between different networks based on their IP addresses. It decides the best path for data to travel across the internet and connects local networks (like your home Wi-Fi) to external networks.

## What is an ISP?

An ISP (Internet Service Provider) is a company that provides access to the internet. They supply IP addresses, manage network infrastructure, and route your connection to the broader internet.

## What are packets and how are they used to transfer data?

Data sent over the internet is divided into small pieces called packets. Each packet contains part of the data plus addressing information. TCP ensures reliability by checking that all packets arrive and requesting any that are lost during transmission.

## What is a client?

A client is a device or application (like a web browser) that sends requests to a server and displays or processes the responses — for example, rendering a web page.

## What is a server?

A server is a computer or system that stores and delivers resources, data, or services to clients over a network — typically hosted in a data center.

## What is a web page?

A web page is a digital document built using HTML for structure, CSS for style, and JavaScript for interactivity, delivered from a web server to a client browser.

## What is a web browser?

A web browser is software that retrieves, interprets, and displays web pages, allowing users to navigate the internet (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Firefox).

## What is a search engine?

A search engine is a system that crawls and indexes web content, then uses algorithms to return the most relevant results for a user’s search query (e.g., Google, Bing).

## What is a DNS request?

A DNS (Domain Name System) request translates a human-readable domain name (like google.com) into its corresponding IP address so that your device can locate the correct server.

## Describe the process when you initiate a search on google.com

When you type “google.com” and press Enter, your browser first checks DNS to find Google’s IP address. The request is sent via your router and ISP to Google’s web server using HTTP/HTTPS. Google’s servers process your search query, look through their indexed web database, and return a results page which your browser renders on screen.
